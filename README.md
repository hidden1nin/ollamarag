# RAG Example Integration with Ollama Nodejs and LanceDB

This repository provides an example implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Ollama Nodejs and LanceDB. This integration was previously undocumented, making it difficult for developers to get started.

## Requirements

To run this example, you'll need:

* Ollama
* Llama3.1
* nomic-embed-text

## About the Implementation

This implementation demonstrates how to integrate Ollama Nodejs with LanceDB to create a basic RAG system. The code provides a clear example of how to use these technologies together, making it easier for developers to get started with their own projects.

## Future Goals

In the future, we plan to turn this example into an NPM package, making it even easier for developers to integrate Ollama Nodejs and LanceDB into their own projects.

## Getting Started

To run this example, simply clone the repository and run ``npm install`` then ``node index.js``. This will run the example code.
We hope this example helps you get started with RAG using Ollama Nodejs and LanceDB!
